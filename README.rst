Introduction
============

occmodel is a small selcontained library which gives a
high level access to the OpenCASCADE modelling kernel.

For most users a direct use of the OpenCASCADE modelling
kernel can be quite a hurdle as it is a huge library.

Most of the code have been adapted from the freecad and gmsh
code (both GPL 2). Also some general geometry code have been
apdapted from the openNURBS library (public domain code)

The license is GPL v2.

Building
========

 * Python 2.6 and Cython 0.16.
 * A working installation of OpenCASCADE (OCE prefered) and GLUT.

The extension have only been build on the Linux platform.
