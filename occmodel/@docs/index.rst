occmodel documentation
**********************

**Overview**

occmodel is a small selcontained library which gives a high level
access to the OpenCASCADE modelling kernel.

For most users a direct use of the OpenCASCADE modelling kernel can be
quite a hurdle as it is a huge library.

Most of the code have been adapted from the freecad and gmsh code
(both GPL 2). Also some general geometry code have been apdapted from
the openNURBS library (public domain code)

The license is GPL v2.
