occmodel documentation
======================

**Overview**

occmodel is a small self-contained library which gives a
high level access to the OpenCASCADE modelling kernel.

For most users a direct use of the OpenCASCADE modelling
kernel can be quite a hurdle as it is a huge and complex
library.

Most of the code have been adapted from the freecad project (GPL 2).

Also some general geometry code have been apdapted from the
openNURBS library (public domain code)

The license is GPL v2.
